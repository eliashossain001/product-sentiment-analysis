# Product Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** on **Amazon Product Reviews** using a combination of **traditional Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques. It provides a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EliasHossain001/product-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd product-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install required libraries (create virtualenv if preferred):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the code:

   * For ML models: go to `ML/`
   * For DL models: go to `DL/`
   * For preprocessing: check `Preprocessing_code/`

4. Run example scripts to train and evaluate models:

   ```bash
   python ML/train_model.py
   python DL/train_lstm.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

* Include Transformer-based models like BERT
* Deploy as a sentiment analysis web API
* Improve data balancing and augmentation techniques
